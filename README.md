There were a lot of "female tech spotlights" interspersed throughout the Girls Who Code Curriculum. I found it encouraging to hear about women doing amazing things in the tech world. Therefore, I decided to create an app to showcase these women and their accomplishments. The user can flip through facts about female CEOs, entrepreneurs, researchers, etc. I just thought it would be a fun way to put my coding skills to use and keep track of the females I had learned about during my time as a Girls Who Code teacher.
